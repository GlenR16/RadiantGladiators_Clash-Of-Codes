## Summary
The problem statement was to create a Machine Learning model to evaluate and score dating app profiles. After scoring the ML model should be able to match users
with similar preferences and scores. We made a scoring weighted scoring system that evaluates several important features of a user profile. To match users we used
a Elo Rating system that reduces and increases user profiles scores based on their actions on the app.
